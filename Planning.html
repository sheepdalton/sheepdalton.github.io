        <p>Your plan must be presented as an indented to-do list. The more comprehensive and well-structured your plan,
            the higher your potential grade. The machine grading will take into account
            the level of detail and forethought demonstrated in your submission.
        </p>
        <p>To achieve top marks, you need to demonstrate your ability to break down a large problem and
            structure your solution using headings and subheadings. Each heading should include several
            sub-points, and some sub-points can also serve as headings with further sub-points.
            Your ability to anticipate problems, create backup plans, and develop contingency plans
            will contribute to the depth and quality of your solution.
        <p>
        <i> Please note, however, that the machine-generated mark is approximate. It exists to help reduce your stress. </i>
        If your plan lacks coherence,or <b>contains nonsense or gibberish , human evaluators may adjust the
        grade accordingly </b>. Redundant or duplicated elements may identified and marked down by human markers.
        You don't have anything to worry about if you are writing a well strutured honest plan.
      </p>

        <p>
        Additionally, plans that are too similar to those of other students may result in reduced marks,
            as it is highly unlikely that two students would independently produce identical plans.
</p>
        <p>
            You will not receive additional marks for overly lengthy explanations, although they are not prohibited. It is important to demonstrate your ideas in a concise yet clear manner

        </p>
        <h4>If you encounter problems</h4>
        <p>
You are encouraged to be creative and invent the bank and any security measures you believe it may have. Should you encounter any issues while creating your plan, view these as opportunities for problem-solving. You can document these challenges in the form provided at the end, which may result in extra marks for demonstrating critical thinking.

        </p>
        <h4>Do not discuss this with others</h4>
        <p> This is an indiviual assignment.  You should not discuss this with other students verbally or online. The university is not responseble if any student breaks these rules and is investigated and/or arrested. This is a purely hypothetical exercise.
